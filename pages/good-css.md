After eight years of designing in the browser, this is a short list of things I believe to be true.

## What good CSS does
- Doesn't break <b>any</b> functionality of plain html.
- Makes an interface more readable for <b>everyone</b> on any device.
- Enhances the usability of an interface for all devices.
- Allows you to quickly change a single interface without breaking other unseen interfaces.
- Renders quickly in the browser.
- Is 60fps (no jank on window resize or during scrolling).

## What good CSS is

-  Highly reusable - even across projects.
-  Well documented.
-  Easy to read and understand.
-  ID free.
-  Mobile-first.
-  Easy to maintain.
-  Very very small.
-  Unassuming.
