A brief look at my design process when building things for the web.

- Try to identify the problem that needs to be solved
- Do research
- Create some content
- Edit content
- Sketch ideas
- Write some words
- Edit words
- Sketch some more
- Build a prototype
- Make it fast
- Make it readable
- Make it work for everyone in every context
- Test it with users
- Ship it
- Test it with users
- Go back to step #1
