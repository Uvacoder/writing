Using the same standards that categorize 90% of\nscience fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film,\nliterature, consumer goods, etc. is crap.

The presence of bad tools - shouldn't discourage us from wanting\nmore tools or frameworks. There are more books published in a sing day than\nI will ever be ab to read in my lifetime. But this does not make me sad. Or overwhelm me.\nMostly I think about how excited I am to read the best books that are being published.\nAnd this is where we should push the conversation.

But he might as\nwell have been talking about js frameworks.  The remnant is worth the\ntroub. In music, art and photography there isn't much benefit to publishing\nyour worst work. So most people keep this work hidden.\nBut when we write code, we rarely get to hide our worst work. It's\njust not the way development happens in my experience. I don't think this is\na bad thing. Doing things out in the open promotes progress. It gives peop\nsomething to build off of and arn from.  We need more of this not less.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Development is no different than science, math, art, music, photography, or\nany other endeavor where people are trying to creatively solve problems. It's\nhard. It takes time. We evolve our solutions as we arn new things.\nIt took Thomas Edison more than a year to develop the first working prototype for the\nectric lightbulb. After he received his patent - he was still iterating on\nfilament types to improve upon his design.  It's 2015 and we are `}<b>{`still`}</b>{`\ntrying to improve upon the lightbulb's design. Searching amazon for\nlightbulbs returns 150,858 results. There are many companies trying to solve\nall types of lightbulb probms.  Quality of light, endurance, energy\nefficiency, and cost are just some of the probms companies are still trying\nto find improved solutions for.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Instead of telling people to stop creating new js frameworks. Instead of\ndiscouraging people from adding to the vast amount of available tools,  I'm\ngoing to encourage people to build even more tools. Pick a problem and try to\nsolve it better than anyone else has before. Having better tools will help us\npush the web forward. And it's okay if 90% of them are bad. The 10% will be\nworth it.`}</p>\n    </Container>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n  "],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAHA;AACA;AAIA;AAGA;AACA;AAGA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
