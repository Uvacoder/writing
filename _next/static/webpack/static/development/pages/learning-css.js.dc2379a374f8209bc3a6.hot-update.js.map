If you learn how HTML works by default - it will help\nyou write better CSS. I learned HTML by reading the spec, and writing lots of\nunstyled HTML. I also spent a lot of time validating my HTML. There have been\na few CSS bugs I've been able to catch by recognizing poorly formed markup.`}</p>\n      <h2>{`Study typography`}</h2>\n      <p>{`The web is largely text. People have been studying what makes things readable\n(as well as what gets in the way of readability) for hundreds of years.  By\nlearning the basics of typography - you'll have a better idea of how to use\nCSS to make interfaces easier to digest for your users.`}</p>\n      <h2>{`Talk to people`}</h2>\n      <p>{`It doesn't need to be coffee, but talk to people! If you work with people who\nwrite CSS, ask them what works for them. More importantly - ask them what\ndoesn't work for them. Learning about peoples problems will help you solve\nproblems better later on. Find css authors online that you respect and ask them to\ncoffee, or if you aren't around them geographically - ask them questions over\nemail. Maybe ask if they have time to do a video hangout over coffee. Some of the most\nimpactful things I have learned have been because I met up with someone in\nreal life and was privileged to ask them questions about their approach and\njust what they are up to. Asking `}<a href=\"http://twitter.com/dam\" class=\"link dim blue\" title=\"Kristofer Josef on Twitter\">{`@dam`}</a>{`\nout for coffee one day helped push my own development knowledge forward.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Write a lot of CSS. Make a ton of mistakes.\nOne of the best ways to learn how to not make mistakes is to make a ton of\nmistakes.`}</p>\n      <h2>{`Think critically`}</h2>\n      <p>{`Learning doesn't happen by accident. Some people author css for years and\ndon't get much better at it.  It's not enough to just practice passively. I\nthink practicing with intent is a much more efficient way to get better.`}</p>\n      <h1>{`Read a lot of code`}</h1>\n      <p>{`All CSS for websites you have access to is open source by default.  This is\npretty rad for a few reasons. One being that you can read\nthe source code and learn learn from it.  There are also a lot of open source css\nprojects written by people who spend a lot of time thinking about css. These can\nbe great for observing patterns, abstractions, and techniques for solving various problems.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Read about how people write code that is not CSS`}</p>\n      <p>{`I believe authoring CSS is a lot different than programming.  I also believe\nyou can learn a lot from reading about the learnings of great programmers.\nTry on all the shoes.  Throw away the ones that don't fit, and keep the ones\nthat do.  If you are looking for some things to read - I have a\n`}<a href=\"http://mrmrs.cc/reading\">{`reading list`}</a>{`\nthat I keep updated with articles that have altered how I think about writing code.`}</p>\n    </Container>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n  "],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAHA;AACA;AAIA;AAGA;AACA;AAGA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
