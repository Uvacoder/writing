During this period of time Jackson taught me a lot about living life, being a designer,\nand being a better person.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Pick one small thing and do it every day. Over and over. Focus on quantity\nnot quality. Quality will come as a direct result of quantity. This is the\nquickest and most efficient way I’ve found to attain the agency to build\nanything you can dream up. You don’t have to work in 5 hour stretches. An\nhour of dedicated work a day will go a long way.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Have fewer things. The fewer things in your life, the more mental energy\nyou’ll have for other stuff. Our shared apartment space consisted of a\nsmall desk, a folding table with four folding chairs that were kept in a\ncloset when we weren’t using them, and a set of speakers. That was it. My\nroom contained a twin mattress on the floor. Jackson's contained a futon\nthat he only put down as a bed at night when we went to sleep. My LA house\nwas not so minimal and the contrast in my mental energy for creativity was\nnoticeable immediately.`}</p>\n      <p>{`If you don’t have furniture you probably have enough space to bike around\nin circles inside.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Read a lot of science fiction.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Cats are fascinating and misunderstood creatures that you can learn a lot\nfrom.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Not everyone has great eyesight. Type shouldn’t be smaller than 16px and\nmost copy should probably be even bigger than that because if you don’t\nwant everyone to read the words you put on a page why put them there at\nall. Some fonts are tough to read for dyslexic people. These people matter\ntoo, in fact, all of your users matter. They are the most important thing\nto design for.`}</p>\n      <p>{`You should constantly try lots of different products whether or not you’d\never be inclined to use them in real life. You can find design lessons in\nmany places. But you must go looking.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Working with people is more fun and rewarding than trying to be a wizard\nrockstar all by yourself.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Biking in circles around your apartment will generally lead to an immense\namount of fun.
