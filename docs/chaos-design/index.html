His earlier writing influenced generations of scientists, Darwin included. Scientific historians have noted &quot;...astronomy has historically led the way in the development of scientific methodology, later applied to other disciplines.&quot; We think of science as being a mature discipline but in reality Biology didn&#x27;t become mature until the mid 19th century. So here is Herschel, urging Darwin to study and borrow methodologies from other disciplines to advance his own.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">About a year after meeting with Herschel - Darwin drew this initial sketch, with the note &quot;I think.” </p><img src="https://mrmrs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/writing/sketch.jpg" class="css-fztd8c"/><p class="css-fetbeq">23 years after their hillside chat, Darwin finally published the Origin of Species.

As one does with friends.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">Now there were two things in particular and about these tables of data that were troublesome. First off, the numbers were wrong. Secondly, it took people a lot of manual time to produce all of these inaccurate calculations. After finding yet another error, in a moment of pure frustration Herschel’s friend exclaimed:</p><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">‘I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam&#x27;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">&quot;I think it&#x27;s possible&quot; replied Herschel</p></blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">That friend, was Charles Babbage,  the man who invented the concept of a digital programmable computer. Hard not to love how his concept of automation is centered around steam.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">This drive to create the first computer was rooted in Babbage&#x27;s effort &quot;to eliminate the risk of human error. The infallibility of machinery would eliminate the risk of error from calculation and transcription&quot;. He saw the world how it was and saw a vision for a different world we could be living in.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">It&#x27;s hard not to appreciate the significance around the fact Herschel was present and involved in the origin story of two fairly significant ideas within the arc of human knowledge. The modern computer, and the theory of evolution.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">When we think about evolution we often think about this image.

Good enough to catch the interest of a Count Ada Lovelace. She was the first person to recognize how powerful the idea could be if extended beyond just pure calculations. Together they pursued the design and construction of a programmable computer for years. Sadly their ideas <b class="css-ucf4qi">didn&#x27;t</b> evolve directly into the devices we know as computers. Their ideas died off. It wasn&#x27;t until after the computer was invented that their early ideas were recognized. It seems people didn&#x27;t have the same drive to fix spreadsheets that Babbage did. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">194 years after this fateful event in London, which for reference is 41 years after the first personal computer, Paul Ford published a 40,000 word piece called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" class="css-16d3z1v">What is Code</a>.

That seemed too high and I am skeptical. My curiosity was sparked. How important are these spreadsheets? How big are these errors? So I read <a href="http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm" class="css-16d3z1v">Raymond Planko&#x27;s research paper from 1998 titled &quot;What We Know About Spreadsheet Errors&quot;</a> which was featured in a special edition of “The Journal of End User Computing’s” on scaling up end user development. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">TL;DR the errors are very big and the spreadsheets are from Fortune 500 companies.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">This is a partial breakdown of errors from one spreadsheet</p><style data-emotion-css="1w3br6e">.css-1w3br6e{margin-left:0;padding-top:0;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><ul class="css-1w3br6e"><style data-emotion-css="1h10mn7">.css-1h10mn7{padding-left:0;line-height:1.5;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;font-size:16px;box-sizing:border-box;}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-1h10mn7{font-size:20px;}}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-1h10mn7{font-size:20px;}}</style><li class="css-1h10mn7"> 10 errors of  $100,000</li><li class="css-1h10mn7"> 6 errors of $10+ million</li><li class="css-1h10mn7"> 1 error of $100+ million</li></ul><p class="css-fetbeq">Reading through the auditor comments, was more amusing than I expected.</p><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">&quot;The investment&#x27;s value was overstated by 16%.

To see the wonders computers can do today contrasted with their failure to solve the original problem that frustrated him so. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">I&#x27;m interested in this sentiment. Where are we spending lots of rote time doing calculations incorrectly? As someone who has spent a lot of time refactoring css, a few things quickly come to mind. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">I want to revisit evolution, because part of what I’m here to speculate on with you is how things will evolve around us.

An interface can be defined as “a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact”</p><p class="css-fetbeq">I’ve always thought about books as a point where an author and a reader can meet and interact.  Books facilitate endless amounts of meetings across time and space. Cataloging an idea in a book can be such a powerful force, that it compels someone to sail from London to South Africa in 1836.</p><p class="css-fetbeq">So, if we are to learn from books, we might find ourselves asking - how has printing evolved since its inception and where is it going now? In &quot;A Short History of the Printed Word.&quot; Warren Chappel describes what he calls the three phases of print.</p><h2 class="css-roynbj">The first phase</h2><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">“It involves the carving of whole pages into flat wooden blocks, and thus treating the written text like any woodcut illustration”</p></blockquote><img src="https://mrmrs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/writing/code.jpg" class="css-fztd8c"/><p class="css-fetbeq">This sounds like the first stage of many peoples design process. Thinking in pages. Or &quot;large sections&quot;. Makes sense as a starting point. It&#x27;s easy to wrap your head around a page. It is easy to have a meeting to look at &quot;a page&quot;. How many of you have ever created (or received) a design spec for an entire page to implement? How many of you have worked this way in the last 5 years? 2 years? 1 year? Last month? Will we look back on this as an ineffecient way to work?  </p><h2 class="css-roynbj">The second phase</h2><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">“The second phase depends on the carving and casting of individual letters or characters. Once these units of visible language have been cast in multiple copies, they can be endlessly assembled, disassembled, and reassembled into an infinite number of texts. That is what is meant by movable type.” </p></blockquote><style data-emotion-css="141vze4">.css-141vze4{padding:16px;width:100%;width:100%;width:100%;width:100%;color:inherit;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-141vze4"><img src="https://mrmrs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/writing/prims.jpg" class="css-fztd8c"/></div><style data-emotion-css="g31n6x">.css-g31n6x{margin-top:0;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:4px;margin-bottom:32px;max-width:38em;max-width:38em;max-width:38em;font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><p class="css-g31n6x">Icons, Colors, and Typography</p><style data-emotion-css="10avxx0">.css-10avxx0{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;height:auto;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;height:auto;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;height:auto;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;height:auto;width:100%;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;color:inherit;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-10avxx0"><style data-emotion-css="6lddm0">.css-6lddm0{padding:8px;margin-right:4px;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;color:inherit;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-6lddm0"><img src="https://mrmrs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/writing/basscss.jpg" class="css-fztd8c"/></div><style data-emotion-css="1rxfi9p">.css-1rxfi9p{padding:8px;margin-left:4px;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;height:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;color:inherit;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;border:1px solid #ccc;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-1rxfi9p"><img src="https://mrmrs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/writing/bootstrapv3.jpg" class="css-fztd8c"/></div></div><p class="css-g31n6x">Type-scale documention for BassCss and Bootstrap</p><p class="css-fetbeq">It feels like we are collectively emerging into this second phase right now.

Spacing. Typography. Color. These can be used across components, pages, or even entire projects. These elements can be combined endlessly to produce a wide array of designs. The invention of movable type didn’t inherently make the writing in books better. And it’s important to note a new css or component architecture is not going to magically improve the quality of our interface design.  But it can have far reaching effects in lowering the barrier of entry for access, giving us more people to help solve some of these problems.

I find myself and my teammates, even against our best efforts, performing a lot of rote tasks, in an effort to get to a point where we can make a decision. And even then we aren’t always successful in that task. While Babbage was the originator of the concept of the computer - JCR Licklider was certainly one of it’s most influential visionaries. It’s hard to come across much early computer work that wasn’t influenced by his thinking. Again - I wonder what Licklider would think about the current state of affairs. Computers no doubt can do AMAZING things. But does it feel like we are living up to our potential?

They wanted to “move from a development model that assumed no breakdowns, to a model where breakdowns were considered to be inevitable.” The thinking is that people will build better systems if they know failure is guaranteed to happen. Netflix found this created alignment around ‘redundancy and process automation to survive such incidents’. What if we applied this thinking to how we build and design components and interfaces? What if we considered the states a user might experience our interface as an incident we’re trying to survive. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">What if we had... Chaos Design</p><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">The discipline of experimenting on a component in order to build confidence in the components capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.</p></blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">Chaos design in practice. If we were to reword the above a bit. We might come up with something like:</p><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">To specifically address the uncertainty of distributed components at scale, Chaos Design can be thought of as the facilitation of experiments to uncover weaknesses in a components implementation or design. Define a ‘steady state’ as some measurable output of a component that indicates normal behavior. Hypothesize that this steady state will continue in both the control group and the experimental group.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">The harder it is to disrupt the steady state, the more confidence we have in the behavior of the system. If a weakness is uncovered, we now have a target for improvement before that behavior manifests in the system at large.</p></blockquote><p class="css-fetbeq">To design stronger and more resilient systems, it can be necessary to spend the majority of your time working outside of the ideal state happy path that contains the perfect set of data. You know. Meeting design stuff. Where everything magically works. </p><p class="css-fetbeq">Think of every characteristic of an interface you depend on to not ‘fail’ for your design to &#x27;work.&#x27; Now imagine if these services were randomly &#x27;failing&#x27; constantly during your design process. How might we design differently?
