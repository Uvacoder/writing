These are a few of the tips I&#x27;ve picked up that have helped me out along the way.</p><h2>Learn HTML</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">CSS just modifies HTML. If you learn how HTML works by default - it will help
you write better CSS. I learned HTML by reading the spec, and writing lots of
unstyled HTML. I also spent a lot of time validating my HTML. There have been
a few CSS bugs I&#x27;ve been able to catch by recognizing poorly formed markup.</p><h2>Study typography</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">The web is largely text. People have been studying what makes things readable
(as well as what gets in the way of readability) for hundreds of years.  By
learning the basics of typography - you&#x27;ll have a better idea of how to use
CSS to make interfaces easier to digest for your users.</p><h2>Talk to people</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">It doesn&#x27;t need to be coffee, but talk to people! If you work with people who
write CSS, ask them what works for them. More importantly - ask them what
doesn&#x27;t work for them. Learning about peoples problems will help you solve
problems better later on. Find css authors online that you respect and ask them to
coffee, or if you aren&#x27;t around them geographically - ask them questions over
email. Maybe ask if they have time to do a video hangout over coffee. Some of the most
impactful things I have learned have been because I met up with someone in
real life and was privileged to ask them questions about their approach and
just what they are up to. Asking <a href="http://twitter.com/dam" class="link dim blue" title="Kristofer Josef on Twitter">@dam</a>
out for coffee one day helped push my own development knowledge forward.</p><p class="css-28jsh3">Write a lot of CSS. Make a ton of mistakes.
One of the best ways to learn how to not make mistakes is to make a ton of
mistakes.</p><h2>Think critically</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">Learning doesn&#x27;t happen by accident. Some people author css for years and
don&#x27;t get much better at it.  It&#x27;s not enough to just practice passively. I
think practicing with intent is a much more efficient way to get better.</p><h2>Read a lot of code</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">All CSS for websites you have access to is open source by default.  This is
pretty rad for a few reasons. One being that you can read
the source code and learn learn from it.  There are also a lot of open source css
projects written by people who spend a lot of time thinking about css. These can
be great for observing patterns, abstractions, and techniques for solving various problems.</p><h2>Read about how people write code that is not CSS</h2><p class="css-28jsh3">I believe authoring CSS is a lot different than programming.  I also believe
you can learn a lot from reading about the learnings of great programmers.
Try on all the shoes.  Throw away the ones that don&#x27;t fit, and keep the ones
that do.  If you are looking for some things to read - I have a
<a href="http://mrmrs.cc/reading">reading list</a>
that I keep updated with articles that have altered how I think about writing code.</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/learning-css","query":{},"buildId":"uQKaeUW6myokUSJxaX1Mf","dynamicBuildId":false,"assetPrefix":"/writing","runtimeConfig":{"linkPrefix":"/writing"},"nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/learning-css" src="/writing/_next/static/uQKaeUW6myokUSJxaX1Mf/pages/learning-css.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/writing/_next/static/uQKaeUW6myokUSJxaX1Mf/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/runtime/webpack-a79426b5e11f0ba5879d.js" async=""></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/chunks/commons.8bc21343389e76635a60.js" async=""></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/runtime/main-a8106584026e076e111d.js" async=""></script></body></html>
