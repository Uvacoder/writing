To create a whole from many petrified, disconnected and given parts, to make this whole appear alive and of a piece — only sculpture in stone approaches the unyielding stiffness of perfect typography. For most people, even impeccable typography does not hold any particular aesthetic appeal. In its inaccessibility, it resembles great music. Under the best of circumstances, it is gratefully, accepted. To remain nameless and without specific appreciation, yet to have been of service to a valuable work and to the small number of visually sensitive readers — this, as a rule, is the only compensation for the long, and indeed neverending, indenture of the typographer.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">THE REAL reason for the number of deficiencies in books and other printed matter is the lack of - or the deliberate dispensation with tradition, and the arrogant disdain for all convention.&quot;</p><cite class="f6 f4-ns fs-normal mt0">**Jan Tschichold** - The Form of the Book</cite></blockquote><h2>Form &amp; Variance</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">The web is fluid. This should be considered when designing screens that are to be rendered by browsers. Last month people visited bluebottlecoffee.com using 1,222 different screen sizes. Building sites that are responsive is only one of the design considerations this introduces. How do you build an interface that is well balanced across all screen sizes? How do you build these interfaces quickly? How do you build them to be readable? How to do you build them to be performant? How do you account for the unknown?</p><h2>Accounting for the Unknown</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">Besides designing for an ever growing number of screensizes and resolutions we must also account for the settings a user picks for their browser. One of these settings is the base font-size. While this can&#x27;t be detected with site analytics, it&#x27;s estimated from user research studies that 10-12% of people set their default font-size to something other than 16px. So how do we build designs that scale proportionally and relatively for the myriad of combinations between devices and font-sizes that people choose to view the web on? How do we design components and interfaces to be harmonious with each other in the faces of so many unknowns?</p><h2>Proportions</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">Using relative sizing units - we can ensure that measurements will remain proportional no matter what font-size a user has chosen. An explicit pixel value however - will not scale relative to a users settings. This leads to designs that may be responsive - but do not posess the desired visual harmony. Static comps with explicit pixel values are not reflective of the raw materials that make up the web.</p><h2>Alignment</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">The reality of front-end development is that people of varying skill levels will inherently touch your front-end code. This is not a bad thing, but it is a problem that requires design solutions. You must have a system in place that makes it easy for people to build well balanced interfaces with as little difficulty as possible. Not everyone will care about the quality of code, or how it renders to the browser. Not everyone will test the interface on a wide variety of devices with various font-size settings. The best solution I have seen so far is to use a defined system for people to work within, that doesn&#x27;t make them think about things they don&#x27;t want to think about. The result of this is that regardless of the interface you are working on - your components will all have the same sets of relative proportions and things will just magically line up without time lost to debugging or re-inventing the wheel.</p><h2>It&#x27;s just text</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">The web, is mostly text. People have been studying typography for centuries and we would be smart to leverage the findings of brilliant designers dedicated to this craft. Regardless of the medium - most great design is mathematically based. When designing around text, modular scales and attention to proportion is considered to be the start of a sound approach. Consider this exerpt from Tschichold&#x27;s &quot;Form of the Book&quot;:</p><blockquote><p class="css-8eq1hr">The geometrically definable irrational page proportions like 1:1.618 (Golden Section), 1: V^2, 1: V^3, 1: V^5, 1:1.538, and the simple rational proportions of 1:2, 2:3, 5:8 and 5:9 I call clear, intentional and definite. All others are unclear and accidental ratios. The difference between a clear and an unclear ratio, though frequently slight, is noticeable.</p></blockquote><p class="css-8eq1hr">While all of these scales would be a good starting point to use for creating a beautiful and harmonious design - all but one lead to sequences of non integer numbers. The 1:2 scale (powers of two) leads to a series of integers that browsers don&#x27;t have difficulty rendering. While computers were largely invented to compute mathematical problems, browsers are notoriously horrible at math. They compute simple arithmetic equations and render values inconsistently. To avoid complicated and unsolvable debugging sessions where things don&#x27;t line up - integers are the best route.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">These ratios are common patterns that can be seen in print, architecture and music so often it is hard to deny them as an elegant underlying order.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">Katsura Villa, a Japanese residence and temple is &quot;founded on the unit of the tatami mat which measures 90:180cm&quot; or a 1:2, powers of two ratio. &quot;The aesthetics of this architecture lie in the beauty of its proportions and the materials used.&quot;</p><p class="css-8eq1hr"><style data-emotion-css="fztd8c">.css-fztd8c{width:100%;display:block;max-width:100%;width:100%;display:block;max-width:100%;width:100%;display:block;max-width:100%;width:100%;display:block;max-width:100%;border:0 none transparent;border:0 none transparent;border:0 none transparent;}</style><img src="http://mrmrs.cc/writing/img/design-systems.JPG" class="css-fztd8c"/></p><style data-emotion-css="tz8tlf">.css-tz8tlf{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;width:100%;color:inherit;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-tz8tlf"><style data-emotion-css="c7qrf8">.css-c7qrf8{padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;width:33.33333333333333%;width:33.33333333333333%;width:33.33333333333333%;width:33.33333333333333%;color:inherit;box-sizing:border-box;}</style><div class="css-c7qrf8"><p class="css-8eq1hr">  <img src="http://mrmrs.cc/writing/img/ds-1.jpeg" class="css-fztd8c"/></p></div><div class="css-c7qrf8"><p class="css-8eq1hr">  <img src="http://mrmrs.cc/writing/img/ds-2.jpeg" class="css-fztd8c"/></p></div><div class="css-c7qrf8"><p class="css-8eq1hr">  <img src="http://mrmrs.cc/writing/img/ds-3.jpeg" class="css-fztd8c"/></p></div></div><p class="css-8eq1hr">Katsura Villa</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">A scale comprised of <strong>5, 10, 20, 25, 30 etc. cannot be represented by a ratio</strong>. They are ticks on a numberline not seen anywhere else in nature, print, architecture or music when studying cohesive design systems.</p><h2>Why use 16 as a base?</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">The default font-size for most browsers is 16px and this is no accident. This is a font-size comparable to type in a book. While printed type is often smaller it&#x27;s partly because books are often times held closer to the face then digital screens. While mobile phones and tablets are generally held at the same distance as books they are also used while moving more frequently - this movement affects the readability of word shapes and so 16px is generally the smallest type for content you want to serve up to a user.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">In this sample list of graphics display resolutions, you will notice that all of these numbers are divisible by 16, one exception that is not listed here is the SXGA+ graphics resolution that is not approved by any organization and was a break from the mold. It resulted in some weird graphics problems... but that is a different story for a different time.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">Granted not all browsers are used at full screen 100% of the time - but it&#x27;s a good thing to consider when trying to create proportional designs that scale well. While we aren&#x27;t print designers working within a fixed medium - there are consistencies in almost every graphics resolution which we can use to our advantage. It should be noted that these numbers are often times indivisible by 5 and only divisible by 10 50% of the time.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" class="f5 w-100 code"><tbody><tr><th class="tl fw6">Name</th><th class="tl fw6">x (px)</th><th class="tl fw6">y (px)</th><th class="tl fw6">x:y x×y</th><th class="tl fw6">(Mpx)</th></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1152</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">768</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">3:2</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">0.884</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1280</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">768</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">5:3</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">0.983</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1280</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">800</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">16:10</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.024</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1360</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">768</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">~16:9</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.044</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">FWXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1366</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">768</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">~16:9</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.049</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">XGA+</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1152</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">864</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">4:3</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">0.995</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WXGA+</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1440</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">900</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">16:10</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.296</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">WSXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1440</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">960</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">3:2</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.382</td></tr><tr><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">SXGA</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1280</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1024</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">5:4</td><td class="pv1 bb b--light-gray">1.310</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="css-8eq1hr">While 5 and 10 are common units because we are often born with ten digits on
our hands - it seems more suitable to use 16 as a base measurement for this
medium. Time in music is most commonly divided this way as well. 1/16, 1/8, 1/4
1/2 and whole notes. These paralells are not a coincidence. Math and music are
the sisters of design.</p><h2>Inclusive Design</h2><p class="css-8eq1hr">It&#x27;s easy to fall into the trap of designing for one context. If you have
working legs, you are not likely to notice that a building has been constructed
with a long staircase that is not accessible to someone in a wheelchair. If you
can&#x27;t walk up stairs, you definitely notice.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">It&#x27;s important to not make assumptions about our users and their capabilities.
And we have to actively question our designs and identify where we are making
assumptions. I have better than 20/20 vision. When I first started out as a
designer I used a lot of small font-sizes. I thought they looked aesthetically
pleasing. I still do.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr">But when I&#x27;m designing, I&#x27;m not designing for myself. I&#x27;m designing for
everyone. It should be considered that compared to a 20 year old&#x27;s retina, the
retina of a 40 year old only receives about 50% of available light. An 80 year
old retina only receives about 20%. So text set at lower font-sizes and/or low
contrasts are actually impossible for some people to read. For reference, a
quick scan of age demographics from my personal site analtyics reveals that
40%+ of people that visit my websites are above the age of 35<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-8eq1hr"><strong>Everyone can read large type.</strong> Not everyone can read small type. In a
similar fasion: everyone can walk up a ramp, while only some people can walk up
stairs. I think we should be welcoming to our web guests and cater to their
accessibility needs because it&#x27;s the right thing to do. It&#x27;s a frustrating
experience to be required to zoom in just to read text. So let&#x27;s not make
people do it.</p><h2>Bibliography / Further Reading</h2><ul><style data-emotion-css="1h10mn7">.css-1h10mn7{padding-left:0;line-height:1.5;font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;font-size:16px;box-sizing:border-box;}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-1h10mn7{font-size:20px;}}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-1h10mn7{font-size:20px;}}</style><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography">Modular Scales</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/">What Screens Want</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/">The Web&#x27;s Grain</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Form-Book-Morality-Typography/dp/0881791164">The Form of the Book</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="https://ia.net/topics/100e2r">Easy-2-Read Standard</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="http://jxnblk.com/writing/posts/mathematical-web-typography/">Mathematical web typography</a></li><li class="css-1h10mn7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216">ISO 216</a></li></ul></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/design-systems","query":{},"buildId":"7v9_muE-vAVJabk2bE86x","dynamicBuildId":false,"assetPrefix":"/writing","runtimeConfig":{"linkPrefix":"/writing"},"nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/design-systems" src="/writing/_next/static/7v9_muE-vAVJabk2bE86x/pages/design-systems.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/writing/_next/static/7v9_muE-vAVJabk2bE86x/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/runtime/webpack-a79426b5e11f0ba5879d.js" async=""></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/chunks/commons.b9ce50c6a2abb9e7bd22.js" async=""></script><script src="/writing/_next/static/runtime/main-7d0fa47387ea68b3cf2b.js" async=""></script></body></html>
