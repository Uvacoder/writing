Measure is an oft-neglected yet important part of typography on the web.

Even for someone who constantly ponders matters of readability and legibility,
it is difficult to determine whether something can be read with ease, but the
average reader will rebel at once when the type is too small or otherwise
irritates the eye; both are signs of a certain illegibility already.
